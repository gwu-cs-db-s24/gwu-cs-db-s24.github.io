Please follow the instructions below carefully. Failure to follow these instructions may result in your project not being graded completely. **Your system must be populated with "starting state data" specified at the end of this document – this is a requirement for the project.** This is the same data as was used in Phase 1, but now you will need data from all components you are combining if you are an integration project.

On the Phase 2 due date by the time of your demo you will need to submit (1) your source code on Github (2) a GitHub Issue to be referred to during the demo that provides the following information (which we will need to conduct our testing):
  - Specify the roles of the team members – i.e.,  specify who did what (which modules were implemented by whom etc). A longer version of this will be included in your report as described below.
  - Provide us with the usernames and passwords for the different users in the system defined below (i.e., the Grad Sec –GS  role, faculty reviewer, CAC, sys admin, applicants).
  - **YOU MAY NOT MAKE ANY EDITS TO YOUR CODE AFTER YOUR DEMO STARTS!**

## Schedule and Evaluation of Demos

The demos will be scheduled in class in lab.

  <!-- - Each team will be assigned a time slot (and an evaluator)– your team must be ready with your main webpage open and running. You should join the class Zoom and enter your group's breakout room 10 minutes before your start time. IF the previous team demo is running significantly beyond its scheduled time, we will notify you on slack and/or email. -->
  - ALL team members have to be present for the demo -- questions will be asked of all team members. Failure to attend the demo without prior approval will result in a grade of zero for your Phase 2.
  - The project testing/demo will require you to go through the entire workflow of your system, and we will be testing it for correctness and completeness. We will take you through specific steps and you are required to follow our directions.
  - Your system must work correctly, and must meet all the workflow requirements that were specified. So make sure you get the system working correctly and make sure you do a lot of error checking and testing.
  - You will have a chance to demo any extra features you added.


## Requirements on testing data and start state of database
Your main page should have a “RESET” button **OR** you must have a script handy that you can use to reset the database. The reset will bring your database to a starting state (i.e., erase all the data and populate it with the data specified below and any other test data that you wish to add). The reset is nothing but a bunch of delete statements followed by insert statements.

Listed below is the state that you must get to after a Reset operation. You may add other data as well to show off your features. **You should combine data from all components in your final project if you are an integration type project.**

**Note**: If you are using a different format for IDs than listed below (such as an Int starting at 1) or are using email addresses instead of user names, that is also acceptable, but make a note of this in your issue.
